# pw
#### Command-line tool to store and retrieve passwords in a structured JSON file in users home

Learning Go programming this is one of my first tiny projects. pw stores and retrieves user passwords in ```~/.pw.json```. Run

```
git clone https://github.com/danbim/pw.git pw
cd pw
go build
go install
```

to install pw and make sure ```$GOPATH/bin``` is in your ```PATH``` environment variable. Then, run 

```
pw site password "site description"
```

to store the password ```password``` for site ```site``` with description ```site description``` (description is optional). Run

```
pw site
# password
```

to retrieve the password from the storage.

## Mac OS X comfort
If you're on Mac you can use the nifty ```pbcopy``` command that will copy its ```stdin``` to the Mac OS X clipboard so you can quickly paste it anywhere you need it (typically a Browser window). 

If you're additionally running the fish shell you might want to try this little function from ```~/.config/fish/functions/pwc.fish```:

```
function pwc
	set PASSWORD (pw $argv)
	echo -n $PASSWORD |Â pbcopy
end
```

that will do the trick for you so that running ```pwc site password``` and ```pwc site``` will automatically leave you with the password in the clipboard.

## Disclaimers
Seriously, this is just a tiny learning project for writing Go code. It just does the most basic things of JSON serialization and file disk access and is in no way a safe way to store passwords. I use it for storing non-critical site passwords as my disk is encrypted anyways and I don't want to sync my passwords with any Chrome cloud service.
